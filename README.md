This is the repository for the demo project Campfire in the Woods which was made for the Pelifarmi project. The project was done in-between lessons during a 2 month period of 30 hour weeks. The team started as a 2 person team (me and one other) and later we got 2 more people to work on it, but we got dropped during gate 3 of Pelifarmi and moved into other teams, so this project was never finished.

Campfire in the Woods is a horror-themed survival game from an angled top down perspective where you have to survive against the cold by keeping your campfire alive, explore the forest, avoid traps, fight enemies and find your way out. 

This repository is used for portfolio and demonstration purposes ONLY.

Team: Esa (me) - programmer and designer, Tony - programmer, 3D artist and designer, Jesse - 3D graphics, Joona - 2D art and map design.
